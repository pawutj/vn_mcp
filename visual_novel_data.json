Everyone pushed on. Everyone was intent and earnest…A bond was formed deep in our hearts, and we obtained a moment that could not be replaced.That’s why someone fell in love.

I'll crush that Monster Army no problem.\"It was Rance, back from an adventure with his companion, Sill.There was an uproar among the world leaders:The Kingdom of Leazas's Queen, Lia Parapara Leazas.The Kingdom of Zeth's Viceroy, Magic the Gandhi.The Republic of Helman's President, Sheila Helman.The Free City Alliance's Representative, Copandon Dot.The eastern island of Nippon's Lord, Kou Oda.The world's largest religion, Alicism's Pope, Crook Mofus....And they were also Rance's women, so they all agreed. Rance became humanity's supreme leader, and their final hope.Over 6000 years a minuscule creature called Kayblis fought and slaughtered his way to the very top of the Monster Realm. A conceited man named Rance who declares all woman to be his lived a carefree life and found his way to the top of the Human Realm. Both men put the survival of their entire race on the line in an inescapable struggle to the death.[FromMangaGamer]"

But though madmen and tyrants fall to his blade, never will he claim that his battle is right.For the tsurugi he wields is cursed Muramasa, which five centuries ago brought ruin to the land, and innocent blood is the price it demands in exchange for its terrible might.\"Where there are demons, I slay them.

            "DescriptionYou awaken in a decrepit old mansion.A woman with eyes of jade stands before You, informing You that You are the Master of the house, and she Your Maid. However, You have no memories, no concept of self—or, indeed, any certainty that You are even alive.The Maid invites You to join her on a journey through the mansion's lifeless halls, to behold the numerous tragedies that have befallen its residents. She suggests that among them, perhaps You will find some trace of Yourself.Beyond the first door lies the year 1603.It is an era of unparalleled beauty, where art and theatre flourish. Roses bloom abundantly in the garden where the inseparable Rhodes siblings play, and though they appear to be free of worry and strife... not everyone is content to see them happy.Beyond the second door lies the year 1707.In this era, the mansion lies in ruins, and a beast dwells within. He claims to yearn for a life of serenity, but it is not long before he yields to his innate savagery and a massacre ensues.Beyond the third door lies the year 1869.In this technologically advanced era, people are always on the move. The mansion's master is an ambitious businessman who has invested in the rail industry. However, his obsession with wealth and power leads him to neglect and mistreat his wife.Beyond the fourth door lies the year 1099.The Maid tells You that this is the final tale. In this era, You see a young man who claims to be cursed and a girl with white hair, called Giselle, who has been branded a witch and marked for death.Having borne witness to these four tragedies, each set in a different time and place, You are now free to choose whether You wish to end Your story here... or press on.But there are those who would say, \"You were able to bear them because they weren'tyourtragedies.\"[FromMangaGamer]"

            "DescriptionSubarashiki Hibi is a story told in seven chapters. The story follows a group of several Tokyo high school students mostly through July of 2012 and each chapter is told from the perspective of one of its five main characters. Because of the same timeframe coverage, certain events are overlapping from chapter to chapter but at the core of it all is a mystery revolving around the prophecy about the end of the world on July the 20th as well as the events that are following before the said date. The first part of the VN is used to make a setting for the said mysteries while the second part is about uncovering the truth behind them all.The story begins in chapter #1, 'Down the Rabbit-Hole I\" on July 12, 2012. The protagonist, Minakami Yuki, lives a peaceful everyday life with Tsukasa and Kagami, her childhood friends, when one day she meets a mysterious girl, Takashima Zakuro (a girl in another class in Yuki's school, who seems to have met Yuki before but Yuki doesn't remember her). The strange schoolmate Yuki just befriended moves into her house (Yuki doesn't mind too much about that). Then following this new guest in Minakami's residence, Yuki's two childhood friends mentioned earlier also move in, just so that they don't feel left out. These events are just a prelude for what will ultimately lead Yuki to discover her own \"Wonderful Everyday\" during this chapter.In chapter #2,\"Down the Rabbit-Hole II\", the story still follows Minakami Yuki in the same timeline as before albeit with a different set of events and their outcomes. This time, Yuki learns that Takashima Zakuro has killed herself. Rumours in school are abuzz about predictions of the end of the world in 2012 - one of which is a Web site called the \"Web Bot Project\", a network of crawlers designed to harness the 'collective unconsciousness' to make predictions. A boy in Yuki's class named Mamiya Takuji stands up and makes an apocalyptic prediction, stating that the world will end on the 20th, that Zakuro's death was the first sign. He speaks of an event he dubs \"the End Sky\", where the world will be destroyed and reborn. The clock is ticking and more people die as the prophesied date draws closer and closer while Yuki attempts to get to the bottom of the identity of Mamiya Takuji, the Web Bot Project and the End Sky.[Edited from Asceai'sreview]"

As if things couldn't get any more strange, there's a bizarre mark on the wall painted in their father's blood, of an inverted cross with a snake wrapped around it. It's the mark of a secret society in their very own school - a secret society which worships the devil.Furious that God could let something so callous occur on a holy day, Michael turns his back on the figure he so dearly worshiped beforehand and vows to get his revenge while investigating the cult that had something to do with the destruction of his family."

The slope in front of it stretches out like an unending ordeal.Another sigh, quieter and shorter than mine, pulls me from my thoughts. I glance over and see a girl standing just as motionless. She's in her third year too, but I don't recognize her. Her short hair catches the breeze, fluttering just above her shoulders.\"Do you like this school?\" she suddenly asks, not really to me, more like to herself.\"I really, really like it. But nothing can stay the same forever. Everything has to change,\" she murmurs, her voice trailing off. \"Can you still like this place, even then?\"\"You just need to find what you love about it, right?\" I chime in, catching her off guard. \"You haven't really thought about what makes you happy here, have you?\"Back when we were younger, everything seemed simpler—everyone felt that way at some point.\"Come on, let's go,\" I say.And together, we begin to climb the long, winding slope.[Based onthe official site]"

It was an overly common battle tale. However, no one thanked or praised them for their victory. In fact, no one even knew them at all. Even so, the future of humanity was protected and it came to a happy end.Now around ten years later, it was spring, the season of meetings and farewells. Those who had once saved the world have forgotten ‘magic’ and lived as normal girls with ordinary encounters and problems. Taiga was approached by the transfer student Haru, who made a request of him:“Please turn me back into a mahou shoujo.”[FromHau~ Omochikaeri~!]"

            "DescriptionThe year is 20XX, and the declining nation of Japan has built the ultimate casino resort: Shinkoumi. This \"special administrative region,\" once known as Tokyo Waterfront City, is functionally its own separate country under the complete control of a private managing organization known as the Takasatogumi.With the economy in turmoil, the masses flock to Shinkoumi with the hope of getting rich quick, or at the very least, venting the stress of their overworked, underpaid lives. With no restriction on who can enter, crime has flourished, and entire districts have decayed.Our protagonist, Towa, lives a life of indolence on the third floor of a small neighborhood clinic. For you see, he has a hobby: painting human desire. Specifically, the moment before those suppressed urges break free from their constraints. And to do so, naturally, he must experience it himself firsthand.In the art world, he is known as \"euphoria\".It can be dangerous to grant people's darkest desires – sometimes, even deadly. But in the spirit of avant-garde, Towa is willing to die for his art...[From the digital manual included withr59230]"

The legendary Ninth Correctional Precinct was an inescapable fortress, constructed on a remote island far out in the open seas.Once upon a time, in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo, there lived an eccentric young man named Minato Shuuichirou. He was infamous among law enforcement as the \"Flasher.\" Shuuichirou absolutely loathed the idea of clothing, and being stark naked was just second nature to him.He was a daredevil who lived life on the edge, never hesitating to put his neck on the line time and time again. Then, one fateful sunny day, his luck ran out, and he was arrested for public indecency and obstruction of justice.In court, he passionately defended his actions, claiming his brazen exhibitions were a form of art. Nonetheless, his arguments landed with a thud, as the bewildered listeners couldn't wrap their heads around such an offbeat perspective. He was ultimately convicted of assaulting a police officer and multiple counts of indecent exposure, earning him a 10-year sentence filled with back-breaking labor.To make matters worse, he was considered \"beyond rehabilitation\" and banished to the notorious Tulip Prison.Can this daring exhibitionist make it in a prison packed with shady characters? This institution, ominously nicknamed \"HENTAI,\" is anything but a picnic for the unlucky folks stuck inside.[Translated and edited fromofficial website]"

            "DescriptionRewrite is set in the fictional city Kazamatsuri where treeplanting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and flowers in much the same way that other cities are filled by buildings. However, while most of the city appears to be rural, there are many traditional city elements as well. While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia.Tennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a high school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body; he can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.[Partially taken fromWikipedia]"

However, in Kredon, there's only one thing everyone talks about: ETERNUM—the virtual, hyper-reality MMORPG game released a few years ago that revolutionized the world of technology.With a neural implant that recreates the five senses, it becomes impossible to distinguish between the game and the real world.Thousands of servers form the network of Eternum: from colorful, magic-filled fantasy worlds to foggy sci-fi cities, no world is beyond reach.Nevertheless, looking beyond the surface, there's a darker side to this pretty facade: black markets, torture, rape, illegal content trafficking, unlawful assemblies, data theft… Eternum follows the rules of no man.For some reason, governments turn a blind eye to this; there's no regulation and no control. Some say it's because the game is highly addictive, some say it's because the market moves millions of dollars daily, some say those in power have been bribed, and others say… there's something else going on.And you? What's your role in this story?Well... That's up to you now.[FromItch.io]"

And it's all connected to the strange, silent girl named Yonagi...CASE-1 Hatano RinArishima Kaoru is a 45-year old part-time teacher, stuck in an unhappy marriage and living a life of tedium after having long given up on his dreams of becoming a novelist.One day, he finds out that a student of his, Hatano Rin, is none other than the daughter of the writer he once admired above all others.As the relationship between the two deepens, Arishima grapples with immoral impulses toward this younger girl. But even as his life spirals and his marriage crumbles further, he picks up his pen and starts to write again.CASE-2 Olivia BerryOur stage is set in the heyday of Elizabethan theater, a time where women were prohibited from acting on stage.A young William Shakespeare runs a failing pub together with his blind father.

            "DescriptionKensuke trained hard every day under the tutelage of his uncle Kazuto. One day, when he held a sword he found in the storehouse, he lost consciousness. When he came to, he found himself in a place he did not recognize. He met a girl who introduced herself as Oda Saburou Kuon Nobunaga. She held out her hand to a stunned Kensuke and asked him to become her husband and accompany her on the road to national supremacy.They travelled across the country, racking up victories in this period of social upheaval. However, there was one enemy they could not defeat: the oni. These man-eating, blood-drinking beasts soon took over all of Japan, plunging the country into hell. However, Kuon and Kensuke vowed to continue fighting, issuing a written appeal to all the influential lords: “Samurai who are not afraid of even the oni, gather under me and let us save Japan together!”[FromHau~ Omochikaeri!]"

            "DescriptionFive hundred years ago, angered by humanity's sins and arrogance, God recalled his Angels from Earth and the surface was consumed by Chaos. The last person who still prayed to God, the first Saint Irene, asked for his forgiveness. God listened to her prayers and lifted the city and land around her to save humanity from extinction. As the last bastion of humanity, the city of Novus Aether floats in the sky above the inhospitable surface, powered by the daily prayers of the Saint. More than a decade ago, due to the interruption of the prayer, the \"Gran Forte\" occurred, causing part of the city to fall to the surface and splitting the lower city in two.In time, the lowest layer became the dwelling of all kinds of low-lives, people who lost much of their former lives during the \"Gran Forte,\" becoming known as the \"Prison.\" However, a contagious disease that causes people to grow wings has spread throughout the city. A special unit has been formed to deal with these people swiftly.In this \"Prison\" resides Caim Astraea, a freelance ex-assassin who does odd jobs for his friends for money, refusing jobs that require him to kill people. During one request, Caim finds a girl who contracts the wing-disease, enveloped in a light that reminds Caim of the \"Gran Forte\" years ago..."

One night, during their festival, a woman was murdered, and the people came to speak of this as their god’s curse—divine retribution for trying to take the power of their god into their own hands.December 1957.It’s been nearly two years since the events ofKara no Shoujo.Reiji Tokisaka’s little sister Yukari saves a man from suicide—but that man is a victim of the curse’s return…Reiji steps in to sever a cycle of obsession that has persisted since before the war—but still struggles with his own obsession.Meanwhile, a cult rises from the ashes after six years of silence—but what are they planning?Curses may be the devices of the gods, but it’s always human hands that carry their knives.[Based onShiravune's description of The Shell Part II: Purgatorio]"

            "DescriptionThe year is Showa 33—or 1958, by the new calendar.It is an especially cold January, and amid the dour gray snow, a funeral is being held. A portrait of a girl’s face sits there draped in snow, looking almost embarrassed and a little lonely…The imprisoned painter Shinzo Mamiya died a scant few weeks after the Blessed Congregation’s crimes came to light. Detective Reiji Tokisaka has been recruited by his old friend Maris Stella to help sort through the man’s belongings, but instead they find an unknown work in his studio: a one-winged angel with no arms. The work, which they name Exile Of Paradise, is as beautiful as it is sinister—and it resembles his infamous masterpiece Girl In Shell.A few more days later, a woman’s corpse is found, modified in the manner depicted in Exile. She is identified as having formerly worked with Tomoyuki Masaki.There may be no one left who can cut the chain of obsession that began with Girl In Shell—nobody but one small girl.E quell’ossessione fa girare il sole e tutte le stelle.[FromShiravune's description of The Shell Part III: Paradiso]."

            "DescriptionEver17 is the tale of seven individuals who become trapped 51 meters below the surface in the underwater marine theme park 'LeMU'. After an incident, almost half of LeMU becomes flooded, and the path to the surface and the communication lines are cut off. In addition, LeMU is under constant assault by severe water pressure, limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours. Escape is not the only concern, however; many questions arise as to the legitimacy of the accident and whether or not those trapped there were brought there for a purpose.[FromWikipedia]"

He explains that it will be about a lonely shinigami and a girl, and their search for the most beautiful word that exists.One day, when Sayo looked up at a clock tower that has long ceased to move, she met a man wearing strange white clothes. When she asked him who he is and why he is wearing such weird clothes, he told her that he has no memory of his identity and that the only thing he knows is that he is a shinigami. Sayo suggests that if he does not know his name, she'll give him one and named him ‘Ao’ (blue) after how similar the man’s eyes are to the colour of the sky.[Edited from4 Shiki]"

Oosaki, a detective, receives a request to attend the ceremony on someone’s behalf.However, the ship meant to bring them back fails to show up at the appointed hour, no one has heard a thing from the coordinator of the event, and there seems to be an inexplicable fear and hatred between all of the attendees.Stranded on an ominous island, ten people try to unravel the mystery of the threads weaving their past and the death of the actress named An Ooe.An unconventional mystery set in the Showa era with a Japanese twist on the classic closed circle literary device.It is the year 1955, mid-showa period. An era characterised by chaotic sentiments, with traces of war still visible. The attendees, accompanied by doubts and their devotion to An Ooe, come to the memorial service in an abandoned village. They manage to overcome the barriers of status and spend their time in harmony. However, the situation changes when the servant who helped them until then is found dead. Driven by extreme suspicion, they start to search for the murderer, but this is followed by a second and third crime...Attendees = All Criminals = Love Interests.All nine attendees can be pursued, including the servant, who’s the first to meet an unnatural death. In each route, the focus lies on solving the mystery and romance. The number of attendees who can be pursued increases as you pass through the prologue, and more options and profiles are added each time you clear the game.

            "DescriptionTheprotagonistloves boobs and maids above all else. He visits a maid café everyday where his childhood friend,Mei, works and dreams about one day becoming a real master while playing a maid themed social game. Suddenly one day, the screen on his phone starts shining. Before they knew it, he, Mei and Mei's mother,Maasa, were transported to another world. They arrived at a bathhouse of a maid academy, where various races learn to become good maids! They encounter nine maids that shake their nice, plump breasts.Soon after, thechairwomanof the maid academy told him that the nine maids he had met at the bathhouse had been cursed by a certain curse and could not serve their masters. They are known as the \"Damned Maids\". However, the curse of this world does not apply to the protagonist, a visitor from another world, and it turns out that the cursed maids are people who can serve him. The protagonist is begged by the chairwoman to become the master of those girls. To become the master of maids at the maid academy in Fifrecia, the country of maids....this request did not need much thinking to answer.\"I'LL DO IT!!\"Thus, the protagonist finally became the master he has longed to be. For the cursed maids, as well, the appearance of a master to serve was a long-cherished accomplishment. The maids compete with each other to serve the protagonist with their erotic services. The mothers of the maids also provide support for their daughters, seducing the protagonist with the services of their voluptuous bodies. In addition, when the protagonist arrived in another world, he had acquired an irregular skill, the \"dirty service skill\". This skill boosts the sincerity and ulterior motives of the maids, and both parents and children serve the protagonist with their dirty services. And so the goal is to win the most prestigious competition in Fifrecia, the \"MAID-1 Grand Prix\". Who would have thought that these girls, who were abhorred as cursed maids, would gain a master who appeared from another world and later cause a great upheaval in the Grand Prix? The protagonist's sexual battle, led by 10 maids (plus their mothers), including Mei, is now about to begin!\"I'm going to raise all my titty maids to be perverted maids with the best of intentions and ulterior motives!\"[Translated from theofficial website]"

Tomohisa doesn't remember it clearly, either. One day, he finds a notebook. It is about history and things happened at a small town. It's just eccentric, so no one pays attention to it.

Change is coming, but in one little convent in the north of the kingdom, everyone has seemed blissfully unaware.Everyone except Sister Catherine, a beloved nun and firebrand thinker who has just been murdered. In an isolated monastery with an already mysterious reputation, any one of the Sisters could be the killer—and Mother Superior is as stumped as anyone else. That's where you come in.As an Anchoress, you took an oath to never leave your cell; to devote yourself entirely to God and provide spiritual support to all who came to your door. But as the only Sister who couldn't possibly have committed the crime, you have a new mission: solve the case, before the bishop shutters the convent and the killer goes unpunished.The Superior hasn't told everyone why you've suddenly joined the regular congregation, but something tells you most of these women know exactly what's going on. Who can you trust? Who is being honest, and who has their guard up—and why? Is the convent really haunted? Who killed Sister Catherine? And worst of all... are you next?[FromSteam]"

Will Yuuji prove to be the element the girls around him needed to take hold of their lives once more, or will the weight of their pasts prove too steep a wall to overcome?And in the first place, just who is Kazami Yuuji? While the true nature of the \"job\" he is wont to alight to at the most haphazard of moments remains shrouded in secrecy, one thing is for certain - his encroachment upon the quiet orchard known as Mihama Academy will prove itself momentous in one way or another. And of course, one cannot discount the possibility that perhaps Yuuji himself carries the weightiest past of any of the students..."

            "DescriptionMedieval society was divided into three orders: the men of prayer, the men of war, and the men of the plow.The Kingdom of Litovia, located in East-Central Eurodia, was bordered by two powers: the northerly Kingdom of Armekia, and the Confederation of Minotaur Tribes in the Labyrinth Forest, both of which put great pressure on Litovia.As the humans began clearing land for civilization, raids and pillages by the minotaurs increased. The Kingdom of Litovia attempted to subjugate the minotaurs with force, but suffered a great defeat... and despite efforts at reconciliation, raids and pillages continued.The Litovians also proposed an alliance against the minotaurs with its northern neighbor, the Kingdom of Armekia, but the answer that came back was an overbearing one.\"We'll help you if the queen of Litovia becomes my wife.\"Such a marriage would mean that the nation of Litovia would have to collectively convert from the Church of the Eastern Rood to the Church of the Holy Rood. The Litovians could not accept this.Moreover, due to the minotaur raids, Litovian military strength in its border regions was greatly reduced, forcing the queen of Litovia to make a painful choice as to whether to tax her subjects to the bone and buy peace with money... or to reinforce the border garrisons, despite the lack of available manpower. Therefore, she turned to a last and most desperate resort, ordering the monasteries near the border to organize their own garrisons to defend themselves.One of the monasteries that received this order was called Berensch, and among the monks who lived there was our protagonist, Astor."

At eight-years-old nothing is better than what feels like endless days of school-less adventures, especially when you live walking distance from the beach. While coming home under a scorching sunset one fine evening, Jamie is approached by a stranger. The man is looking for a kid who can do him a favor, and he’s even offering to pay for it. He wants Jamie to please be friends with his only child. The person is Mr. Holden, Jamie’s new neighbor as well as the father of the odd, and oddly named, boy Cove. Whether Jamie wants to play along or not, Cove isn’t going anywhere. He's present in Jamie's life for far longer than they ever would've guessed.And somehow the long days of vacation finally come to an end. Summer may not be able to last forever, but Jamie can take comfort in knowing it will come back again someday…[Fromitch.io]"

During the commotion, the two rush to the rooftop. They see bodies lying in the street and smoke in the distance.A strange talking cat approaches them and asks them to become 'warriors' in order to fight against 'Biomonsters'. Panicked, Chiyoko is first to agree. She receives a round gemstone-looking transformation device along with a rather painful needle in the back. She suddenly finds herself able to travel faster than the speed of sound. Together with Haruka they are barely able to fend off the Biomonsters.The cat tells Chiyoko and Haruka they have to search for more students with the potential to become 'warriors' like them. Over the next few weeks they continue searching for members, however, Chiyoko's reputation as a dangerous person and her lack of common sense causes her to be misunderstood frequently. Beyond that, not everyone isn't so willing to risk their life. Why should they be? This isn't the army. No-one is there to force them to join, or to keep order.Some reach out to others. Some reach out to their friends anew. Others sit back and watch anxiously or with disapproval. Even as the threat of annihilation grows, their personal worries remain in the air.The days ahead lay filled with turmoil, large and small."

With a rich military history stretching back further than any other nation, it has been ruined by years of corrupt governance. Amidst the decay, and with whispers of civil unrest and potential invasions from neighboring nations growing louder each day, a man once exiled from Helman has risen to the challenge.The crown prince, Patton Misnarge, who vanished after a failed attempt to invade a neighboring nation to prove his worth years ago, has returned. Having matured and honed his skills through rigorous training, he is determined to reclaim his homeland. His audacious plan involves rallying the peerless fighters he encountered during his travels to lead a small but elite force to revolutionize Helman. To perfect this daring strategy, Patton turns to an unlikely ally—the most formidable and brutal warrior of them all, Rance.Note from the developer: This standalone story can be enjoyed without playing the previous series. However, prior knowledge of the Rance games can enhance the player's experience. Consider playing \"Rance VI,\" \"Sengoku Rance,\" \"Rance Quest,\" and \"Rance 01\" to gain deeper insight into the world and characters.[Based onMangaGamerandofficial site]"

With Patton's forces are supreme beings of great power, who are unable to be wounded by any of Leazas's strongest warriors—fiends. The castle was occupied in a matter of moments and Leazas's ruling monarch, Princess Lia was taken captive.Is this the end of Leazas?As the mighty nation becomes a thing of the past in but a single night, one ninja flees the castle, taking with her one of the country's national treasures and a simple message from the princess. With the nation's last shred of hope, she heads to the Free City of Ice in the west. She heads to the brutal warrior, who has nothing in his head but thoughts of beautiful women.[FromMangaGamer]The gameplay has been completely revamped featuring a unique dungeon system with cards with several playable characters unlockable over the course of the game and the story changed in some ways to better adapt to the current plot of the ongoing games.While the plot has overall remained unchanged, several characters have been added and their backgrounds given more depth. It's also the first Rance game to include voice acting."

Not long after, that revolution in technology gave birth to a brand new sport, Flying Circus, which used shoes to make players compete in the open sky.Hinata Masaya, who was once considered a prodigy, turned his back on Flying Circus after suffering a crushing defeat, although there was also another reason...However, his former passion is reignited while teaching the new transfer student, Kurashina Asuka, how to fly.This time, Masaya chooses to enter the world of Flying Circus not as a player, but as a coach. Sometimes fighting, and at other times encouraging each other, he and his team decided to challenge the top student-athletes in Japan.Now, with Asuka by his side, how high will he be able to fly?This is a love story about those who met through the sky, as well as the friends who surround them.[Edited fromNekoNyan]"

The story is presented using a blog-like interface.The protagonist, Atemiya Shinobu, who was raised at a certain facility since a young age, had no one around him that could be called a \"friend\". Being that way, the first thing he started doing after leaving the facility with his sister - Chidori - was to find and make friends.Benio Azusa, a tomboyish girl who lived nearby.Hondou Sayaka, a quiet yet sharp-tongued girl who was in charge of raising the pets at school just like him.Tsukamoto Youko and Itsuki, a pair of siblings who belonged to a prestigious family around the area.Higuchi Shouji, a boy he knew by being attracted to the similarities they both share.Izuki Fueko, a girl he met by chance.Together with Shinobu, they were a group of seven. Just like that, each and every one of them, who had never experienced the joy of having friends, was able to meet each other and become companions. The story begins in a quiet town colored by dusk. Around the seven friends, there were understanding, empathy, conflict, and what's more, the fleeting love of adolescence. It was a friendship that could last forever.Such a simple happiness should have... lasted forever.That was until the \"enemy\" appeared.The \"enemy\" had disturbed the peaceful relationship of the seven people.Shinobu could not forgive that. He could not forgive the one that injures his companions, nor could he forgive the one that hurts another one's hearts. And when he realized all that, the world they resided in changed, rather then becoming the new world that it should have... they had arrived at the \"sanctuary\" instead.This is a story that describes the heart.A story that describes the thing located in the farthest end of a heart.[Edited from White Masq and translated from Getchu]"

Even though his mind doesn’t get to rest during his ‘sleep’, he still doesn’t experience heavy fatigue nor have ill health. Instead, he is brighter and more capable than other people his age. He thought of his special ability as one of his good points, and intended to live a relatively normal life. That was until he met Mizuki, who also had the same ability as him.They were able to enter the dream world at will, but soon they found themselves caught in a world which could kill people and change history. It was a world from which one cannot escape. They were faced with the choice of either giving up and taking their own lives or to charge forward and try to break through this nightmare. However, they all felt like they were not caught up in this absurd situation by chance, but rather because it was their own wishes.[FromHau~ Omochikaeri!]"

However, many characters and ideas featured in later Rance games originated in Kichikuou Rance.The game begins at the start of LP0003. The warrior Rance, accompanied as always by his faithful slave Sill Plain, has been living as the leader of a group of bandits in northern Helman after killing their previous leader as part of a job given to him by the Keith Guild. While Rance greatly enjoys the raping and pillaging that comes with being a bandit leader, the guilt-ridden Sill believes that he is in danger of losing what remains of his conscience and genuinely becoming a villain.After attacking the city of Golak, Rance's group alerts the attention of Ruberan Tser, commander of the Helman volunteer army, who launches a counterstrike on them during their second attempt at pillaging the city. Unable to fight against a genuine army, the bandits are quickly destroyed, Sill is captured by the Helman Army and Rance is forced to flee for his life.Rance evades the Helman army for several days, with both his equipment and health steadily declining all the while, before he finally passes out from fatigue along the Leazas/Helman border. He is found on the verge of death by Kentou Kanami, the personal ninja of Leazas' queen and Rance's longtime admirer Lia Parapara Leazas, who brings him to Leazas castle. After three days of recovery, Rance finally regains consciousness and, completely humiliated by his defeat at Helman's hands and desperate to rescue Sill, demands that Lia give him the Leazas Army to destroy the enemy nation. Finally seeing an opportunity to have Rance to herself, Lia agrees on the condition that he first marry her, which Rance reluctantly accepts.As the new king of Leazas, Rance sets his first steps on a path that will lead to either world domination or death.[Taken from theAliceSoft Wikia]"

They didn’t have any special abilities to combat these strange occurrences, but then their inner elements awakened and the wheel of dreams begin to turn once more.[FromHau~ Omochikaeri!]"

            "DescriptionThe protagonist, Fiona lived in a secluded tower due to her fragile health. There is turmoil in the country and a severe disease outbreak known as Zodiva or “Mad Wolf Disease”. Mejojo was interested in Fiona due to her upbringing and wanted to take her as his bride, but Fiona’s father refused. There are now rumours in town saying Fiona is a witch- Mejojo and Auger uses this to their advantage and arrest her, so that they can “observe” her while she lives in the castle. Eventually, Fiona’s half-brother (Nesso) and butler (Zara) rescue her and they escape together.The emphasis of the story is on a dark/historical/political fantasy where humans, wolves, cats and other animals are being ruled by two very crafty feline tyrants. Due to various oppressions the cat twins faced in their childhood including assassination attempts, they learned how to survive and gain power- but they were also driven towards insanity. There is nothing they won’t do to get what they want.[FromWhite Prayer's review]"

            "DescriptionTaking place in Japan at the end of World War II. Devastated in the aftermath of defeat, the Japanese government complies with the Allies' reconstruction plan. Japan begins to recover from the loss after a few years, but America and China intricately divide the nation on a municipal level. Eventually, China's military districts become Chinatowns, and places controlled by the United States are Americanized. The many Chinese and American immigrants make Japanese people the minority in their own land. Some Japanese are unwilling to accept this fate and secretly gather their strength to challenge the new system.A girl named Rose Haibara works at the club Primavera and lends money to Japanese people so that they can rebuild their lives. Meanwhile, Leo Shishigami is best known for his reputation among women. Everything begins to change when that legendary man meets Rose in the spring of 1947.[Edited fromAnime News Network]"

The story spans 5 in-game days and is told through a huge number of live-action still photographs. The protagonists are varied, including a high school playboy, a gamer geek police officer, a struggling actor, an ex-Yakuza man, a TV scriptwriter and many more. Each of the protagonists lead a completely different story that even defies genres, with one story having a lighthearted comedy style while another having a dark, ominous tone.The player must play all of the stories in parallel, jumping across different protagonists, and backtracking to re-select branches which not only affect the active protagonist, but also other protagonists through often bizarre twists of causality.Since its release in 1998, Machi has amassed a cult following among Japanese Sound Novel players, causing a yearning for a sequel for years which did not come to fruition until 2008 which had the release of the spiritual sequel, 428: Fusa Sareta Shibuya De."

His cute childhood friend, Mako, makes fun of his delusions, but when he casts his lust-fueled spell... he and Mako suddenly find themselves in the bathhouse of a succubus academy in another world! In Faren'ch Deshka Academy, all the students have boobs that have grown to the brim with milk and bodies fit with perfect proportions!Alas, it turns out our protagonist has been summoned by the academy's chairman in a summoning gacha ritual in order to help revitalize the academy, because its succubi aren't lewd enough. The buxom chairman speculates that perhaps his succubus-summoning spell and her incubus-summoning gacha were synchronized and ended up crossing streams.Apparently, the academy is in danger of being closed down by the Lilingard Ministry of Writhing, which has declared that Faren'ch Deshka must raise its erotic rankings within a year. To save the academy and its source of ero-magical power, the protagonist will need to turn the students into extremely lewd, sexy and obscene, wet dream-inducing succubi!Questioning his own ability, the chairman uses her \"Sex Scouter\" succubus skill and discovers that he has been bestowed god-level erotic skill as well as the Legendary Book of Sexy Magic! The chairman has no choice but to recognize his legendary powers and entrusts him with the nigh-impossible task of saving the academy. To turn the students into full-fledged succubi, he'll have to seduce them! And with the Book of Sexy Magic at his side... it might actually be possible to conquer this school and become invincible in this new world. It's time to rebuild the succubus school and build a succubus harem![Edited fromSteam]"

            "DescriptionSeaBed is a yuri-themed mystery visual novel told through the perspectives of three separate characters: Mizuno Sachiko, a designer plagued by hallucinations of her past lover; Narasaki Hibiki, Sachiko's friend and a psychiatrist researching the workings of human memories; and Takako, Sachiko's former lover who has been rapidly forgetting her past, including how or why the two women drifted apart despite being together since childhood.All three live in different worlds, but seek the same goal. To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.----I saw a ghost in the living room.But as I was already used to the phenomenon, I did not let it interfere with the preparation of my evening meal.The ghost ate my fried egg and commended its taste.As I listened to her talk, my memories drifted back to the days we were still together.Back when we were in school, she asked me what was necessary for the two of us to be together.A small workplace that we could make a living from without relying on anyone.A silent apartment where we would have the freedom to do what our hearts desired.I told her that.In the late eighties – during the economic boom – the small design company we founded was doing surprisingly well.We visited all the places we talked about when we were in school – the southern islands, the old European cities, the West Coast. We went wherever we wanted, seeing whatever we sought.Alone in that spacious living room, I attempted to figure out why it all ended this way. Why those days when nothing could stand in our way faded into the past.I no longer felt like I could do everything.The world had grown complicated. Even simple matters became difficult.The rules we had established in the past no longer seemed to apply, and the castle we built for ourselves crumbled to dust.\"What is necessary for us to be together?\" – the ghost asked me.We need a make a new place for ourselves.A place no one can destroy.Let's make it a place that no one else can reach.And so, I inconspicuously proceeded with the plan.In a place so deep below the surface that no one else can find it.[FromFruitbat Factory]"

The unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization filled the air with smog, robbing humanity of the blue skies they'd once known.There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the \"Great Disappearance\" reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets.But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe.Unbeknownst to her...There is a place said to be the city's \"Underground.\" This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted. \"Underground New York\" is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural \"sky,\" the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist...Cowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the \"Messengers.\"Suffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the \"Messengers.\"They linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something.A girl named Lily sets foot in this place, her mind devoid of memories. There is only one thing she's certain of. She doesn't have a reason. She doesn't know who or what awaits her. She doesn't even know why she feels this way. But even so, she's absolutely certain.\"Manhattan. The ends of the violet sky.\"\"I have to go there. I'm the only one who can.\"─The girl sets off for the tower of violet shadow looming far in the distance.─With every step, she finds the shades of those yet to fade away.─She isn't aware of the tears she sheds.[FromMangaGamer]"

            "DescriptionThis is the debut game for Uguisu Kagura, which succeeds Yonaki Uguisu. There was a small library on that island. It was the Yuugyouji family’s private library built solely for one girl, Yoruko, who didn’t attend school and spent all her time there. With lots of intriguing books on its shelves, there was no happier place for a bookworm like her. There were also other wonderful and pleasant people who resided there: the protagonist Ruri and his cool sharp-tongued imouto Kisaki, the freeloading tennen moodmaker Rio, and the curious and honest “detective” Kanata. It’s as if they were all brought together by someone or something. Their love of books was the beginning of their youth. Before long, the lonely library became full of light and they became close like childhood friends.Two years later, Ruri returned to the library after leaving the island due to family matters. Nothing seemed to have changed from six years ago, except that there was a secret which they were not aware of back then: “Anything that is written in the magic book will become reality”. If it’s a romance novel, then a miracle-like love story will unfold. If it’s a fantasy novel, then vampires will appear the next day. If it’s a horror novel, then there’ll be a ghost beckoning you from behind.Yoruko’s strong will. Kisaki’s beauty. Rio’s cheerfulness. Kanata’s brilliance. Let’s fall in love with them and books.[FromHau~ Omochikaeri!]"

Aside from the snow which never built up, the town was also struck by other abnormal incidents, such as tornadoes, thunderbolts and floods. Riku is an ‘elfin’ who possesses a mysterious ability known as ‘rune’, which he uses to save others. He returned to Tsukigasaki, where he grew up in an orphanage, along with fellow elfins Rinne and Hinata. Their duty was to protect two young sisters, Ochiba and Hazuki, from rune abilities which go out of control, while also keeping the existence of elfins a secret to the public.When he arrived at the town, a girl in a pure white dress was waiting for him. He used to play with the girl Yuuki when they were small, having snowball fights and making snowmen. To his surprise, she still looked exactly the same as before he left. While she’s sad that the city has since changed a lot, she told him that he still remained the same to her even if he grows up.[FromHau~ Omochikaeri!]"

The locals there have adapted to this peculiar phenomenon, and carry on with their lives as if the rain was never there. No one takes an umbrella, no one wears a rain coat.The main character of the story is 17 year old Chris, a Fortelle student of the famous Piova Communal School of Music (Scuola Comunale di Musica Piova, in Italian). Separated from his childhood sweetheart Arietta when he left his home town for the city, he keeps in touch with her through the means of weekly letters. Penning their thoughts on those letters, Chris treasures and keeps her weekly writings, for he had promised her that should his drawer become totally filled with them, he would return to her.The game starts during Chris's third year as a student, a few months before he has to take the school's final graduation examination: a staged performance. As an instrumentalist, he is required to search for a vocalist partner before he is eligible for the examination.[FromWikipedia]Beside the adventure parts that makes most of the game, Symphonic Rain includes musical sequences. In which the player is required to press keys on the keyboard in correct timing to accompany the current song. These sequences can be turned to automatic if the player doesn't wish to participate."

            "DescriptionEcho is a small, isolated, desert town located in the Southwest. It's seen better days; its businesses closing and population dwindling.During spring break, Chase, a young otter who grew up in Echo, is back for a school project aimed at documenting an event in the 1920's that may have lead to the town's current state. He's joined by five friends, who grew up with him in Echo, taking the chance to have a little reunion. Unfortunately, Chase begins to realize that their memories of Echo may have been a bit rose-tinted. Being back in the town digs up old and painful memories; secrets that lead to rifts in the group that have been boiling under the surface for years. On top of that, Chase begins to realize that Echo itself may have its own secrets. Odd and unexplainable memories that he always blamed on an overactive childhood imagination may not have been imagined at all.Finally, an event is triggered that turns these fears into something much more tangible and dangerous. Chase is now forced into a situation in which he must help his friends either face, or escape their demons. Either way, Echo is not keen on letting them go...[FromPatreon]"

            "DescriptionTaking place in the desolate land of Metafalss, a tiny continent built upon the rim of a tower much like the first game's Ar tonelico, it revolves around two opposed factions: the ruling Grand Bell, which has recently declared war against the Goddess Frelia; and the Sacred Army, who believe that the Goddess enables Metafalss to exist. This ire against the Goddess stems from a failure centuries past at creating Metafalica, a paradise-like land spoken of in legend, which was interrupted by a vicious attack by her defenders. In addition to civil war, Metafalss is ravaged by outbreaks of I.P.D, a Reyvateil-specific disease which causes the victim to execute song magic uncontrollably and do much damage to herself and her surroundings.Protagonist Croix Bartel, a knight of the Grand Bell, is regularly tasked with stopping the harm done by those afflicted. It is while on a mission to contain one such outbreak that Croix, together with his adopted sister Cocona, is put in quite a different situation. The Holy Maiden Cloche, the Reyvateil who leads the Grand Bell in the war, has come under attack by the Sacred Army. He is soon entrusted with protecting her while they escape. While attempting to hide from the Sacred Army, they encounter Luca, another Reyvateil who has known Croix since childhood.Croix is soon to discover that neither the Grand Bell nor the Sacred Army are what they seem- and nor are Cloche or Luca. Unable to trust anyone except each other (and sometimes not even that), he and his companions struggle along their own path to thwart those who would manipulate them, discover the truth about the Goddess Frelia, and achieve the seven hundred year old dream of Metafalica.[FromTVTropes]Like its prequel, Ar tonelico II features the Dive System, in which you can enter a Reyvateil's mind to help them with their inner doubts in visual novel-style sequences and by doing so unlock more powerful Song Magic. Diving is now more closely tied to the main storyline, and completing more than half of a Reyvateil's cosmosphere will require you to 'commit' to them and their ending.Other new mechanics include Dualstall, in which the Reyvateils take baths together to increase their power; Bath Talk Topics, which occur during Dualstall and make the various Reyvateils fight more confidently alongside each other; and Infelsphere, a dreamlike realm closely linked to the plot in which the heroines deepen their bond with one another in VN-style sequences."

            "DescriptionAfter six years,Toorureturned with his younger sisterNatsuhato the remote village of Monobeno deep in the mountains of Kochi prefecture. They reunited with the Akashaguma (child-like Yamori Youkai)Sumi, the KasayouHishakaku, and his childhood friend and self-proclaimed fiancéeAlice. They played in the mountains, visited the shrine, and were visited by the Ushi Oni Tooko just like in the past.Just as they were getting used to living in Monobeno, it was time for the Shichi Seisai summer festival dedicated to the local deityHimemiya-sama. The festival was lively, concluding with the masked dance. While watching the dancing, Natsuha suddenly started shaking, complaining that her body felt cold. Tooru quickly took her toNaotake— the doctor and Alice's father, but nothing seemed wrong with her. They went to play in the nearby stream the next day. Hearing the waterfall caused Natsuha to panic and run in fear, but they couldn't find a reason for her peculiar actions. That night, she appeared in front of them very much an adult, and she bled in her nether regions for the first time. Unable to figure out what caused these inexplicable changes, they could only calm her down and watch over her. Another shock awaited them in the morning when they found Natsuha had returned to her normal size but without any memories of the day before.They decided to head back to the city for a proper examination. Unfortunately, a major landslide blocked off the only entrance to the village. Natsuha wished to leave badly, saying something scary was approaching her. What was causing Natsuha's changes? Was it a disease or a curse? Tooru was determined to find the cause and a way to save Natsuha.[Edited fromHau~ Omochikaeri!]Monobeno -Happy End-is the remake ofMonobeno, with after stories for Sumi, Alice, Natsuha, and a pre-story for Hishakaku. It also rewrites parts of Sumi and Alice's route, which seem to be bad ends for Natsuha, and adds a toggle for certain CGs. Upon players' requests, the H-scenes are more numerous and intense. All in all, it's a happy ending for everyone.In Sumi's after story,Tooru trains hard to turn back the clock for Natsuhawhile supported by Sumi and theirdaughterEmi, who has a unique ability to see ''holes'' which link the youkai world.In Alice's after story, Tooru's happy life with Alice after fleeing the clutches ofHimemiya-samais disrupted by the appearance of a young girlSeishin Himemiya, whoreverted Alice to a little girl and took her memories.In Natsuha's after story,Natsuha remains in her small form, and Tooru aims to cure her completely.[Edited fromHau~ Omochikaeri!]"

However, one day, her father- her only family- had suddenly disappeared.\"Go to Kaikyuu Academy.\"- That was all what was written on the mysterious letter left behind by him.The private Kaikyuu Academy... A prestigious boarding school attended by sons and daughters from privileged families, founded upon the goal of educating them well in order to give them the tools to support future Japan.Following the letter left by her father, Neri transferred into Kaikyuu Academy, a school where celebrities gather. It is extremely luxurious, however, being grounded upon a social caste system, the academy is dominated by \"social class discrimination\".At the very top of the social hierarchy is the \"Queen\", endowed with incredible political influence, she rules over the students. Superior to everyone else but the Queen are the chosen elites belonging to the privileged class, \"The Roses in Full Bloom\". The commoner class in which most of the students belong in, \"The Nameless Honeybees\". \"The Ignored Stones\"... Even though they're fellow students, those in The Ignored Stones are regarded as having the same rights as a servant- they're oppressed and enslaved. Finally, there is \"The Resistance\", which is an organisation composed of students who oppose the social hierarchy system.In a society far more disparate than she had ever imagined, Neri finds \"love\", and gradually, a certain \"truth\" about the academy surfaces. What is this \"truth?\"[Taken fromOtome Jikan.]"

If anything, the countless lives lost in the battle served as a catalyst to their sacrificial ceremony. Whether or not their attempt bore fruit ― not a soul knows. Following the war, they faded from sight, mind, and eventually into the realm of myth.61 years later ― Japan, 2006.Ren Fujii, a young man attending high school in Suwahara City, finds his friendship with his old buddy Shirou Yusa shatter to pieces following a certain incident, ending in a vicious fight that sees Ren hospitalized for two months.The season shifts from autumn to winter ― to the dawning weeks of December, with Christmas on the horizon. Having lost his best friend, Ren leaves the hospital with the intention to rebuild his new life without Shirou.But even that plan soon falls apart. Irrationality that defies the realm of common sense begins to assault and devour the city. Abnormalities soon seek to destroy everything Ren holds dear before his eyes with overwhelming violence.He must change, even if it means crossing the boundary between the ordinary and the extraordinary. His desires are hardly anything grand. All he wants is to return to those days of old. Back to those days filled with simple, everyday joy.The battle with the Longinus Dreizehn Orden. A continuation of that war full of madness, carnage, and maledictions. What future awaits Ren at the end of his road...?[FromSteam]A thoroughly rewritten and expanded remake ofDies irae Also sprach Zarathustra. Henceforth, the two should be treated as different games."

            "DescriptionThis is a completely different story, another \"Big Tits Fantasy 2\".It takes place 150 years before Big Tits Fantasy. It was a time when demons and humans still coexisted.In the Kingdom of Hillsland, an island country across the sea from the continent of Eurodia, after money came into circulation, the number of demons struggling with money increased,Demons who had lost their families and possessions began to attack moneylenders, and the gap between humans and demons began to widen.The government officials were asked to do something about this rift.Luin Dimidium is from the rural province of Dobrand. His nickname at the royal monastery was \"The Ruin Man\".He ranks last in writing, poetry, and magic, but tops in eloquence. He is the only man to have prevented the gifted seminarians from graduating first in all their subjects.However, he is transferred to the remote town of Boimbala as a military officer (captain of the garrison) instead of a civilian officer, incurring the wrath of Archbishop Alhieff."
